\section{Logic and calculational proofs}
\label{sec:logic}


In this chapter, we continue to exercise our skill of organize areas
of mathematics in DSL terms. We apply our methodology to the languages
of logic: propositions and proofs. Additionally, at the same time, we
will develop adequate notions and notations for mathematical
foundations and learn to perform calculational proofs.
%
There will be a fair bit of theory: introducing propositional and
first order logic, but also applications to mathematics: prime
numbers, (ir)rationals, limit points, limits, etc. and some
Haskell concepts.

\subsection{Recap of syntax trees with variables, |Env| and |lookup|}

\jp{reformulate in book form (or move earlier, or remove)}

This was frequently a source of confusion already the first week so
there is already a question + answers earlier in this text.
%
But here is an additional example to help clarify the matter.
%
\begin{code}
data Rat v = RV v | FromI Integer | RPlus (Rat v) (Rat v) | RDiv (Rat v) (Rat v)
  deriving (Eq, Show)

newtype RatSem = RSem (Integer, Integer)
\end{code}
%
We have a type |Rat v| for the syntax trees of rational number
expressions (with variables of type |v|) and a type |RatSem| for the
semantics of those rational number expressions as pairs of integers.
%
The constructor |RV :: v -> Rat v| is used to embed variables with
names of type |v| in |Rat v|.
%
We could use |String| instead of |v| but with a type parameter |v| we
get more flexibility at the same time as we get better feedback from
the type checker.
%
Note that this type parameter serves a different purpose from the type
parameter in~\ref{sec:toComplexSyn}.

%
To evaluate some |e :: Rat v| we need to know how to evaluate the
variables we encounter.
%
What does ``evaluate'' mean for a variable?
%
Well, it just means that we must be able to translate a variable name
(of type |v|) to a semantic value (a rational number in this case).
%
To ``translate a name to a value'' we can use a function (of type |v
-> RatSem|) so we can give the following implementation of the
evaluator:
%
\begin{code}
evalRat1 ::  (v -> RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat1 ev (RV v)       = ev v
evalRat1 ev (FromI i)    = fromISem i
evalRat1 ev (RPlus l r)  = plusSem  (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
evalRat1 ev (RDiv  l r)  = divSem   (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
\end{code}
Notice that we simply added a parameter |ev| for ``evaluate variable''
to the evaluator.
%
The rest of the definition follows a common pattern: recursively
translate each subexpression and apply the corresponding semantic
operation to combine the results: |RPlus| is replaced by |plusSem|,
etc.
%
\begin{code}
fromISem :: Integer -> RatSem
fromISem i = RSem (i, 1)

plusSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
plusSem = undefined -- TODO: exercise

-- Division of rational numbers
divSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
divSem (RSem (a, b)) (RSem (c, d)) = RSem (a*d, b*c)
\end{code}

Often the first argument |ev| to the eval function is constructed from
a list of pairs:
%
\begin{code}
type Env v s = [(v, s)]

envToFun :: (Show v, Eq v) => Env v s -> (v -> s)
envToFun [] v = error ("envToFun: variable "++ show v ++" not found")
envToFun ((w,s):env) v
  | w == v     = s
  | otherwise  = envToFun env v
\end{code}
%
Thus, |Env v s| can be seen as an implementation of a ``lookup
table''.
%
It could also be implemented using hash tables or binary search trees,
but efficiency is not the point here.
%
Finally, with |envToFun| in our hands we can implement a second
version of the evaluator:
%
\begin{code}
evalRat2 :: (Show v, Eq v) => (Env v RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat2 env e = evalRat1 (envToFun env) e
\end{code}

% \paragraph{The law of the excluded middle}
%
% Many had problems with implementing the ``law of the excluded middle''
% in the exercises and it is indeed a tricky property to prove.
% %
% They key to implementing it lies in double negation and as that is
% encoded with higher order functions it gets a bit hairy.
%
% TODO[Daniel]: more explanation

\paragraph{SET and PRED}
%
\label{par:SETandPRED}

Several groups have had trouble grasping the difference between |SET|
and |PRED|.
%
This is understandable, because we have so far in the lectures mostly
talked about term syntax + semantics, and not so much about predicate
syntax and semantics.
%
The one example of terms + predicates covered in the lectures is
Predicate Logic and I never actually showed how eval (for the
expressions) and check (for the predicates) is implemented.

As an example we can we take our terms to be the rational number
expressions defined above and define a type of predicates over those
terms:
\begin{code}
type Term v = Rat v

data RPred v  =  Equal     (Term v) (Term v)
              |  LessThan  (Term v) (Term v)
              |  Positive  (Term v)

              |  AND  (RPred v) (RPred v)
              |  NOT  (RPred v)
  deriving (Eq, Show)
\end{code}
%
Note that the first three constructors, |Eq|, |LessThan|, and
|Positive|, describe predicates or relations between terms (which can contain term
variables)
%
while the two last constructors, |AND| and |NOT|, just combine such
relations together.
%
(Terminology: I often mix the words ``predicate'' and ``relation''.)

We have already defined the evaluator for the |Term v| type but we
need to add a corresponding ``evaluator'' (called |check|) for the
|RPred v| type.
%
Given values for all term variables the predicate checker should just
determine if the predicate is true or false.
\begin{code}
checkRP :: (Eq v, Show v) => Env v RatSem -> RPred v -> Bool
checkRP env (Equal     t1 t2)  = eqSem        (evalRat2 env t1) (evalRat2 env t2)
checkRP env (LessThan  t1 t2)  = lessThanSem  (evalRat2 env t1) (evalRat2 env t2)
checkRP env (Positive  t1)     = positiveSem  (evalRat2 env t1)

checkRP env (AND p q)  = (checkRP env p) && (checkRP env q)
checkRP env (NOT p)    = not (checkRP env p)
\end{code}
Given this recursive definition of |checkRP|, the semantic functions
|eqSem|, |lessThanSem|, and |positiveSem| can be defined by just
working with the rational number representation:
\begin{code}
eqSem        :: RatSem -> RatSem -> Bool
lessThanSem  :: RatSem -> RatSem -> Bool
positiveSem  :: RatSem -> Bool
eqSem        = error "TODO"
lessThanSem  = error "TODO"
positiveSem  = error "TODO"
\end{code}
